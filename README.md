This repo. is for the Scrum Project in which we (Emal Ismai, Muhhammad Yousuf Sultani, Muhammad Elyad Fikrat, Rayhana Amiri, Zahra Stanikzai, Sayed Shabeer Hashimi) will develop and Dari-English & English-Dari dictionary.


As a user
I want to rate the dictionary after using it
so that the developers could update based on my feedback

P.S. Mr.Shabeer,
You almost covered important things. Thanks for your effort!


Dear Shabeer,

I think you have covered all but I have also added some user stories please add them cause it will make the dictionary more better for the use like adding synonoms and proverbs feature to the dictionary
